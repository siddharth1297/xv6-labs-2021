Print a page table:

Page 0 -> Text and data section (PERM: READ & WRITE & EXECUTE & USER).
Page 1 -> Guard Page (PERM: READ & WRITE & EXECUTE. As USER is not enabled, so user programs are not able to write).
Page 2 -> Stack (PERM: READ & WRITE & EXECUTE & USER).


TRAMPOLINE -> The last(higher memory) frame (511th of the last page directory of last level) (PERM: READ & EXECUTE).
TRAPFRAME -> The second last frame (510th of the last page directory of last level) (PERM: READ & WRITE).
USYSCALL -> The third last frame (509th of the last page directory of last level) (PERM: READ & USER).
